# Evolution-Simulator
A work in progress evolution simulator that shows how traits evolve in organisms in an environment over time.

This is one of the bigger java projects I've worked on and I tried to apply modular and organizational principles to it.
All in all I'm happy with the program design aspect of this project. I tied together terrain generation, basic organism 
design and AI, day and food cycles, population graphs, trait graphs, customizable features, and more into a scalable and
modular project. 

What I'm less happy with is the actual simulation aspect. The more elements I added to this project the more I abstracted
elements of the environment which hurts the evolutionary principles I'm trying to demonstrate with this project. I'm putting
this project on hold as of now but I plan to return to it in the future. When I do, I'm going to work towards restructuring
the environment to better focus on the goals of the project.
